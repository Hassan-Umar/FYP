The U.S. media is\\nthe most pro-israeli media in the world. Having lived in Europe\\nI realize that incidences such as the one described in the\\nletter have occured. The U.S. media as a whole seem to try to\\nignore them. The U.S. is subsidizing Israels existance and the\\nEuropeans are not (at least not to the same degree). So I think\\nthat might be a reason they report more clearly on the\\natrocities.\\n\\tWhat is a shame is that in Austria, daily reports of\\nthe inhuman acts commited by Israeli soldiers and the blessing\\nreceived from the Government makes some of the Holocaust guilt\\ngo away.

You might have to start asking the\\nsame sort of questions of Arab countries as well.

In that He loves us, with a love that we can never understand\\nuntil we are with Him. The Bible says that He looks on the heart as the\\nfinal measure.

DH allows both ends to agree on\\na session key which they use with symmetric cryptography (something\\nlike DES) for the encryption.\\n\\nHow could the \"back door\" keys work in this system?  I can see a few\\npossibilities.  One is that the DH-like algorithm has the property that\\nthe session key can be deduced by an eavesdropper who knows the back door\\nkeys for one (or possibly both) communicants.  Perhaps the random numbers\\nused in the DH are seeded by the back door key, or some such.\\n\\nAnother possibility, as was suggested here earlier, is that the chips\\nsimply broadcast the session key, encrypted with the chip\\'s own\\ninternal secret key.  In this system the back door keys are secret keys\\nusable for decrypting this session key broadcast.  Actually the chip\\'s\\nsecret key doesn\\'t need to be a public key in this usage, but can be\\nidentical to the secret back-door key.  (This proposal seems most\\nstraightforward to me.)\\n\\nStill another possibility is that the encryption algorithm used for the\\nmessage itself has a \"dual key\" property, that possession of either of\\ntwo keys can be used to decrypt it.  One key would be the session key from\\nthe DH exchange, and the other would be the back door key for the chip.\\n\\nIt\\'s worth noting that one of the proposals Dorothy Denning raised\\nduring her amazingly prescient on-line discussion last November and\\nDecember was a variation on Diffie-Hellman in which a third party would\\nparticipate in deriving the session keys.  This doesn\\'t quite fit into\\nwhat we know of how Clipper works but it hints that those who had early\\nknowledge of Clipper (or whose thinking was somehow synchronized with\\nClipper designers) may have had Diffie-Hellman on their minds.', \"GAME(S) OF 4/15\\n---------------\\nADIRONDACK 6\\tCDI 2\\t(Adirondack leads series, 1-0)\\n\\n=================================================\\t\\t\\t\\nFIRST ROUND\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nSpringfield Indians vs Providence Bruins\\nGm 1:\\tSpringfield 3\\tPROVIDENCE 2\\t\\nGm 2:\\tSpringfield 5\\tPROVIDENCE 4\\nGm 3:\\t4/16\\tProvidence at Springfield\\nGm 4:\\t4/17\\tProvidence at Springfield\\nGm 5:\\t4/22\\tSpringfield at Providence\\t*\\nGm 6:\\t4/24\\tProvidence at Springfield\\t*\\nGm 7:\\t4/27\\tSpringfield at Providence\\t*\\n\\nCD Islanders vs Adirondack Red Wings\\nGm 1:\\tADIRONDACK 6\\tCDI 2\\nGm 2:\\t4/17\\tCDI at Adirondack\\nGm 3:\\t4/18\\tAdirondack at CDI\\nGm 4:\\t4/21\\tAdirondack at CDI\\nGm 5:\\t4/23\\tCDI at Adirondack\\t*\\nGm 6:\\t4/24\\tAdirondack at CDI\\t*\\nGm 7:\\t4/26\\tCDI at Adirondack\\t*\\n\\nBaltimore Skipjacks at Binghamton Rangers\\nGm 1:\\t4/16\\tBaltimore at Binghamton\\nGm 2:\\t4/17\\tBaltimore at Binghamton\\nGm 3:\\t4/23\\tBinghamton at Baltimore\\nGm 4:\\t4/24\\tBinghamton at Baltimore\\nGm 5:\\t4/26\\tBaltimore at Binghamton\\t*\\nGm 6:\\t4/28\\tBinghmaton at Baltimore\\t*\\nGm 7:\\t4/30\\tBaltimore at Binghamton\\t*\\n\\nUtica Devils vs Rochester Americans\\nGm 1:\\t4/16\\tUtica at Rochester\\nGm 2:\\t4/17\\tUtica at Rochester\\nGm 3:\\t4/20\\tRochester at Utica\\nGm 4:\\t4/22\\tRochester at Utica\\nGm 5:\\t4/24\\tUtica at Rochester\\t*\\nGm 6:\\t4/26\\tRochester at Utica\\t*\\nGm 7:\\t4/28\\tUtica at Rochester\\t*\\n\\nMoncton Hawks vs St John's Maple Leafs\\nGm 1:\\tSt John's 4\\tMoncton 2\\nGm 2:\\t4/17\\tMoncton vs St John's at Halifax\\nGm 3:\\t4/21\\tSt John's at Moncton\\nGm 4:\\t4/23\\tSt John's at Moncton\\nGm 5:\\t4/26\\tMoncton vs St John's at Halifax\\t*\\nGm 6:\\t4/28\\tSt John's at Moncton\\t\\t*\\nGm 7:\\t4/30\\tMoncton vs St John's at Halifax\\t*\\n\\nCape Breton Oilers vs Fredericton Canadiens\\nGm 1:\\tFredericton 4\\tCape Breton 3\\t(2OT)\\nGm 2:\\t4/16\\tCape Breton at Fredericton\\t\\nGm 3:\\t4/20\\tFredericton at Cape Breton\\nGm 4:\\t4/22\\tFredericton at Cape Breton\\nGm 5:\\t4/24\\tCape Breton at Fredericton\\t*\\nGm 6:\\t4/26\\tFredericton at Cape Breton\\t*\\nGm 7:\\t4/28\\tCape Breton at Fredericton\\t*\", \"\\nYes!

It is \\ndisingeneous to compare their death to that of athletes in Munich\\nor any other act of terrorism or mrder.  This exercise is aimed \\nsolely at diverting the issue and is far from the truth.\\nIt seems to me, Dorin, that, you are so remote and ignorant of the problem\\non the ground that your comments can only be charactrized as irrelevant,\\nand heavily colored by the preconceptions and misinformation.\\nI will try to paint the most accurate picture I can of\\nwhat the situation really is in South Lebanon.\\n\\n\\n\\nI am.  I was back in my home village this last summer.  For your information\\nwe are PEOPLE, not a bunch of indiscriminate terrorists.  Most of the \\npeople in my village are regular inhabitants that go about their daily\\nbusiness, some work in the fields, some own small shops, others are\\nolder men that go to the coffe shop and drink coffee.  Is that so hard to\\nimagine ????  It is NOT a \"terrorist camp\" as you and the Israelis like \\nto view the villages they are small communities with kids playing soccer\\nin the streets, women preparing lunch, men playing cards, etc.....\\nSOME young men, usually aged between 17 to 30 years are members of\\nthe Lebanese resistance.  Even the inhabitants of the village do not \\nknow who these are, they are secretive about it, but most people often\\nsuspect who they are and what they are up to.  These young men are\\nsupported financially by Iran most of the time.  They sneak arms and\\nammunitions into the occupied zone where they set up booby traps\\nfor Israeli patrols.  Every time an Israeli soldier is killed or injured\\nby these traps, Israel retalliates by indiscriminately bombing villages\\nof their own choosing often killing only innocent civilians.  Once they\\nare back they announce that they bombed a \"terrorist  hideout\" where\\nan 8 year old girl just happened to be.\\nWe are now accustomed to Israeli tactics, and we figure that this is \\nthe Israeli way of telling us that \"if you\\'re gonna hurt our soldiers\\nyou\\'re gonna pay the price\".  We accept this as a price we have to pay\\nto free our land, Israel knows very well that it is not really hurting\\nthe resistance that much militarily with these strikes, but rather\\njust keeping the pressure on the villagers to demand from their young \\nmen to stop attacking Israeli soldiers since these attacks are\\ntaking a heavy toll on the lives of the civilian villagers.\\nIsrael\\'s retalliation policy is cold hearted, but a reality that\\nwe have come to accept and deal with, the Lebanese Resistance\\non the other hand is not going to stop its attacks on OCCUPYING \\nISRAELI SOLDIERS until they withdraw, this is the only real \\nleverage that they have to force Israel to withdraw.\\nThe people of South Lebanon are occupied, or shelled by Israel on a \\nregular basis.  We do not want to be occupied.  If Israel insists that\\nthe so called \"Security Zone\" is necessary for the protection of \\nNorthern Israel, than it will have to pay the price of its occupation\\nwith the blood of its soldiers.  If Israel is interested in peace,\\nthan it should withdraw from OUR land.  We are not asking for the \\nestablishment of a Lebanese occupied zone in northern Israel to protect\\nour villages that are attacked on a regular basis by Israel, so the\\nbest policy seems to be the removal of Israeli occupation and the\\nestablishment of peace keeping troops along the border.\\n\\nI have written before on this very newsgroup, that the only\\nreal solution will come as a result of a comprehensive peace\\nsettlement whereby Israel withdraws to its own borders and\\npeace keeping troops are stationed along the border to insure\\nno one on either side of the border is shelled.\\nThis is the only realistic solution, it is time for Israel to\\nrealize that the concept of a \"buffer zone\" aimed at protecting\\nits northern cities has failed.  In fact it has caused much more\\nIsraeli deaths than the occasional shelling of Northern Israel\\nwould have resulted in.  \\nIf Israel really wants to save some Israeli lives it would withdraw \\nunilaterally from the so-called \"Security Zone\" before the conclusion\\nof the peace talks.  Such a move would save Israeli lives,\\nadvance peace efforts, give Israel a great moral lift, better Israel\\'s \\npublic image abroad and give it an edge in the peace negociations \\nsince Israel can rightly claim that it is genuinely interested in \\npeace and has already offered some important concessions.\\nAlong with such a withdrawal Israel could demand that Hizbollah\\nbe disarmed by the Lebanese government and warn that it will not \\naccept any attacks against its northern cities and that if such a\\nshelling occurs than it will consider re-taking the buffer zone\\nand will hold the Lebanese and Syrian government responsible for it.\\nThere seems to be very little incentive for the Syrian and Lebanese\\ngoovernment to allow Hizbollah to bomb Israel proper under such \\ncircumstances, and now the Lebanese government has proven that it is\\ncapable of controlling and disarming all militias as they did\\nin all other parts of Lebanon.\\n  \\n\\nI agree, only in the case of the Isareli soldiers their killing\\nCANNOT be qualified as murder, no matter what you say.\\n\\n I have the feeling that you may be able yourself to make\\n\\nYes, we have no quarrel with Jews, or Israeli civilians.\\nThe real problem is with OCCUPYING Israeli soldiers and those brave\\nIsraeli pilots that bomb our civilian villages every time an \\noccupying soldier is attacked.\\n \\n', '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\tI think the Manta is the European name for the \"GT.\"  I\\'m pretty sure\\nthat the only Kadett\\'s sold here were/are the Pontiac LeMans.

Again, I had a spare hard disk\\nribbon cable, and I wanted to be careful in case this didn't word so what\\nI did was purchase a crimp on 50 pin cable connector that gave me another\\nmale connector in the middle of my spare cable.

The question is,\\nis one of the effect dominant, and which one is it? The idea would be to\\ndesign an experiment which would seaprate the two characteristics, and\\nsee which effect produces a similar result to the one with which those of\\nus who have bikes are familiar.\\n\\nLet's look at the one that, so far, has sparked no controversy on its\\nown, gyroscopic precession. To examine this alone, we would have to\\nget rid of the contact patch effect, by not allowing the contact patches\\nto transmit any force. The wheels and steering mechanism would have to\\nremain, and be attached to a vehicle with about the same weight as a bike,\\nthrough suspension (so that the wheels transmit forces to the bike the\\nsame way) similar to a bikes. An experiment would be to ride a bike along \\na dry road to get moving and to get the wheels spinning, then change \\nsurfaces to something that won't transmit forces through the contact \\npatches, and try a steering manoeuvre to see if the bike leans. It \\nprobably would, since some of us know how easy it is to fall down on ice, \\nbut we wouldn't get a good idea of how well or what it feels like \\nbecause, without the contact patches, we can't turn.  Maybe there's a \\nbetter way. Besides, even ice doesn't get rid of the contact patch\\nforces altogether, so we'd have to find a really frictionless surface.\\nYou'd have to try it again with the wheels locked to really know if it\\nwas the rotation that did it.\\n\\nLooking at the contact-patch effect only, however, is fairly simple.\\nNow we have to find a vehicle that gets the about the same magnitude and\\ndirection of cantact patch forces as a motorcycle, and transmits them\\nabout the same way to the vehicle, but without rotating wheels.\\nHow it gets the contact patch forces is irrelevant, we're just looking\\nfor something that has contact patches that can go straight and not\\nsideways, and skis or skates would do fine. I don't know of any snow-ski\\nor skate bikes, but up here we have the Suzuki Wetbike that is arranged\\nlike a motorcycle but has fat water skis where there should be wheels.\\nI think the propellor is in front of the rear ski, or something like\\nthat, but we could try it at a coast to get rid of most of its effect.\\nNow I admit that this is second hand info (although I'd love to try\\none of these), but the review in the local cycle rag and a guy in\\na bike shop that sells them both say that this machine handles very\\nmuch like a motorcycle, in that you countersteer it to turn.\\nSo we have contact patches that transmit similar forces to a bike's,\\na similar suspension arrangement, and no gyroscopes, but we do have\\ncountersteering.\\n\\nConclusion: you don't need gyroscopes to countersteer vehicles that have\\nmotorcycle-like contact patch arrangements. We still don't know what\\nreal effect the gyroscopes have when they're there, but from my observations\\nof how handlebar angle, force, etc. relate to steering in general, I'm \\nwilling to bet that they're not the dominant factor in countersteering. \\n\\nIf you don't like this conclusion, then don't accept it, but my motorcycle's\\nbehaviour is consistent with it.

(Anyone know a cheap way of converting every atom in the solar\\nsystem into a one bit storage device?)\\n \\n   Actually, a keysearch of this kind shouldn't be much worse than the\\nsimpler kind in terms of speed.
